          | Please provide the computername and password you want to use for submitting self-plays and matches to SAI.
          | You also need to provide a valid email address, which will receive a confirm token for enabling the account.
          | We suggest to create different accounts for different computers. The same email address may be used for
          | multiple accounts.

        p
          | Please note that the computername is exposed in a number of public SAI web pages. Moreover, we do not use HTTPS
          | at the moment, hence password travels in cleartext on the web.

        p
          | <b>DO NOT REUSE THIS PASSWORD FOR ANY OTHER SERVICE.</b>
